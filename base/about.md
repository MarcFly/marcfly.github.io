On this series of pages, you will find anything I find interest or worth making public. Content may range from hobby to professional or even portfolios and personal interests.

The content available mainly focuses on Game-Oriented Programming, Computer Graphics, anything I find neat and learn about and sometimes things outside my career topics.

The categories and tags, are a bit of a mess in this base template, I am working on understanding how to just change it properly into the search to show the tags and categories; then use it you actually search in the page as intended.

In any case, I hope something is worth your time!
