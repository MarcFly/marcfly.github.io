# About this devlog

On this series of pages, you will find anything I find interest or worth making public. Content may range from hobby to professional or even portfolios and personal interests.

The content available mainly focuses on Game-Oriented Programming, Computer Graphics, anything I find neat and learn about and sometimes completely different things.

All posts can be filtered or searched through the tags, categories and a direct text search.

In any case, I hope something is worth your time!
